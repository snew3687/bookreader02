A. Download a book, Plain Text UTF8, from http://www.gutenberg.org
B. Save it as "book.txt" in a properly-named sub-directory of $\bookreader02\public\content\books (as an original backup)
C. Save it, again, as a file "bookChapters.md"
D. Perform the edit steps, as follows:
  1. Delete up to start of first chapter
  2. Add header 2 to all Chapter starts
    %s/\CChapter /## Chapter /g
  3. Delete first 8 lines of Gutenberg preamble, to book title
  4. Break out meta information into JSON file
  5. Delete these lines:
    *** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PRIDE AND PREJUDICE ***
    Produced by Anonymous Volunteers
  6. Deleted from this line, onwards, including licensing info:
    End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen
  7. Delete up to start of first chapter
  8. Good. Already has _italic_ markers in book text
  9. Add in pauses, like:
    %s/--/.../gc
  10. For any pre-formatted text, add block code markup - ```
