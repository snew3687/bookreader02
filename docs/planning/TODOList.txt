Refactoring
===========
+ bookServer.cloneDescriptorWithoutTitles: replace with better method of cloning (shallow) object: 
  * Figure out why Object.create(null, objectWantToClone) did not create a shallow clone in nodejs ??

Technical Ideas
============================================
+ Use Flexbox to layout
+ Use media queries to choose style sheet suitable for device
+ Research the 12-column layout that Dylan mentioned. Bootstrap uses it?
+ Moustache is a simple templating system that might help

Design Ideas
============================================
+ Draw some pictures of what I want the app to look like
+ Navigation controls - may be at the top, or at the bottom


Functionality Idea
============================================
+ Maybe a word-count per-page might be useful for calculating page content?
